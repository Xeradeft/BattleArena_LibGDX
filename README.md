NOTE: Although this project earned full marks, it was far from meeting our group's goals. Given the limited amount of time we had to complete the final project, we had to decide on a much lower level implementation. Aside from actually creating the game, learning LibGDX and creating all appropriate accompanying documents the project required (eg. it was required to use Waterfall SDLC) also took a lot of time out of the approximate month we had.
